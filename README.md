# Geographical information system for risky buildings in Istanbul


Turkey has had to face the earthquake disaster through history.  The reason for the damage in these disasters is the lack of sufficient data and the lack of necessary precautions. But with the new up to date technologies and softwares technologies, significant progress has been experienced in the field of earthquakes. With this project, a MATLAB GUI design was created that can be used to detect damaged structures especially in the expected Istanbul earthquake and later in other earthquake regions around the World. The data used in the project are artificial data and were used in the promotion phase of this project.
